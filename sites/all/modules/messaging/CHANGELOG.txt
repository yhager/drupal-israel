// $Id: CHANGELOG.txt,v 1.1.2.8.2.7 2008/08/05 16:55:04 jareyero Exp $

TO DO
------
* Ability to receive the same message through more than one channel. It should be possible to implement some ‘abstract’ sending method that pipes messages through two or more other channels.
* Sending messages to potential users, with a reserved user id. It seems we are already good for that with latest hooks introduced in notifications module.

  'destination', field for getting destination from user account.
  'subject_glue', to glue multipart message subjects, [Optional]
  'send_user', callback for sending to users [Optional]
- The send callback should accept now a $destination array for bulk sending
