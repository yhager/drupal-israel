= Installation =

* Unpack the project files onto your modules directory (usually
* 'sites/all/modules') Enable the module on the modules page
* ('http://example.com/?q=admin/build/modules')

= Overview =

This module requires coding capabilities, and does not expose any
UI. If you seek UI for creating the tabs, please take a look at
similar projects, like quicktabs.

= Usage =

The tabs are loaded from the server only when the user selects the tab
she wants to view. When the server is asked for the tabs content, it
calls a callback function that you supply.  The callback fills in an
array of tabs with title and content. Make sure to place the callback
in a custom module, or in your theme's template.php file. The return
value of the callback should be an array of tabs, each tab is an array
with 'title' and 'content' keys. For example:

<?php
function magic_tabs_example_callback($active = 0) {
  $tabs[] = array(
    'title' => t('First magic tab'),
    'content' => t('Content of first magic tab'),
  );
  $tabs[] = array(
    'title' => t('Second magic tab'),
    'content' => t('Content of second magic tab'),
  );
  $tabs[] = array(
    'title' => t('Third and last magic tab'),
    'content' => t('Content of third magic tab'),
  );
  return $tabs;
}
?>

(such a function already exists in magic_tabs.module, you can use it for testing).

Note that only the tab with the active content will be visible, so if you don't have to render the content of the other tabs (save processing). For example, you could have written the above function like this:
<?php
function magic_tabs_example_callback($active = 0) {
  $tabs = array(
    array('title' => t('First magic tab')),
    array('title' => t('Second magic tab')),
    array('title' => t('Third and last magic tab')),
  );
  $active = ($active + 3) % 3; // $active could be -1, which means last
  $ordinals = array('first', 'second', 'third');
  $tabs[$active]['content'] = 'This is the content of the '. $ordinals[$active] .' magic tab';
  return $tabs;
}
?>

When you want to present the magic tabs, all you have to do is:
<?php print magic_tabs_get('magic_tabs_example_callback'); ?>

You can display many tabs groups in a page.

== Displaying a custom block ==

The easiest way to display a custom block, is to find out the block id and add:
<?php
  $bid = 2;
  $block = (object)module_invoke('block', 'block', 'view', $bid);
  $block->module = 'block';
  $block->delta = $bid;
  $tabs[] = array(
    'title' => t('Display a custom block'),
    'content' => theme('block', $block),
  );
?>

== Setting the default tab ==

By default, the contents of the first tab will be displayed. 
You can have different tab displayed by using the second parameter to magic_tabs_get() call.

For example, to display the last tab:
<?php
  print magic_tabs_get('mycallback', 'last');
?>

You can use here 'first' (default), 'last' or a numeric value (first is 0).

= Theming =

* You can theme individual tab group by writing your own <yourtheme>_<yourcallback> function.
* You can override the generic theming function by implementing <yourtheme>_magic_tabs.

== Theming an indvidual tab group ==

Assuming your callback is called 'mycallback', it will be themed by calling
<?php theme('mycallback'); ?>, so you can override the theming using the 
usual theme override mechanism in Drupal.
For more info about theming see http://drupal.org/node/55126

== Theming all magic tabs groups ==

Just override theme('magic_tabs') as mentioned above.
if you implement both specific and generic theming, the specific one is used first if it exists, otherwise, the generic one is used.
